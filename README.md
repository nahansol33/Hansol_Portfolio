## Python Job Scrapper
* Launched a development webserver using Flask via Python to host the application
* Developed a web-scraper that allows the user to search for jobs on websites “We Work Remotely” and “Indeed” simultaneously, saving all jobs found and their data into a downloadable csv file 
* Utilized Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Requests libraries to scrape through job sites and gather data, becoming comfortable working with external libraries and documentations
