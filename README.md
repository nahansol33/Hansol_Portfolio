## [Toronto Housing Data Visualization Tool](http://54.160.156.101:8051/)	       
* Hosted a single-page app on AWS EC2 which collects housing data for 140 subdivided areas of Toronto to integrate with a geographical coordinate system to represent data in a visual form of a choropleth using pandas, and Dash plotly
* Implemented a Python script to scrape and extract housing data for Toronto, producing an extensive dataset for analysis

## [Python Job Scrapper](https://github.com/nahansol33/web_scrapper_project)
* Launched a development webserver using Flask via Python to host the application
* Developed a web-scraper that allows the user to search for jobs on websites “We Work Remotely” and “Indeed” simultaneously, saving all jobs found and their data into a downloadable csv file 
* Utilized Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Requests libraries to scrape through job sites and gather data, becoming comfortable working with external libraries and documentations
